# Model Context Protocol (MCP) gateway configuration
#
# This YAML file allows you to register multiple MCP gateways and the tools
# each gateway exposes. Keep credentials in environment variables (see the
# `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` placeholders) instead of hard-coding secrets.
# Agents will only surface tools that are marked as `active: true`.
#
# You can override this path at runtime with MCP_CONFIG_PATH.
