# Workflow guardrails (sparkgen-example)\n\nThis workflow adds RAG- and routing-specific guardrails on top of the platform\ndefaults to keep responses citeable and tool usage privacy-preserving.\n\n- **Citation reminder**: Warns when research outputs lack clear citation cues.\n- **Tool data privacy**: Warns if tool calls could ship user inputs without\n  sanitization.\n\nWhen adding new rules:\n- Reuse the platform categories listed in `allowed_categories`.\n- Include rationale and examples here so downstream teams understand why the\n  rule exists.\n- Provide `tests` in the YAML to make expectations explicit.\n*** End Patch
