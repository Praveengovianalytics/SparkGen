# Workflow guardrails (template)

Describe the workflow-specific guardrails you add on top of the platform
defaults. Examples:
- Citation reminders for research agents.
- Tool-call constraints for privacy and data minimization.
- Style guidance for refusals.

Update this file whenever you add or change rules in `workflow.yaml` so the
rationale stays documented alongside the configuration.
