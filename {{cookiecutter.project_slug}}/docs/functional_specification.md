## 9. High-Level Flow Diagrams

### 9.1 Logical Flow Diagram

Illustrate the overall logical architecture for the project. Below is a generic example for a GenAI chatbot:
1. **User Interaction Layer**: Inputs from UI/UX (web, mobile, voice).
2. **API Gateway**: Routing requests to appropriate services.
3. **Processing Layer**: GenAI model and business logic.
4. **Data Storage Layer**: Interaction logs, feedback, and retraining data.
5. **Response Delivery**: Deliver response back to the user.
